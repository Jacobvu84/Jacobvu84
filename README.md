I am currently seeking a position as an Automation Test Manager to lead and develop an automation testing team. My objective is to create the optimal working environment for software developers and test engineers, thereby enhancing the automation testing process and ensuring high-quality software products.

With my experience in software testing and automation, I aim to apply this knowledge and skillset to build a robust foundation for automated testing. I want to ensure that all testing processes are executed automatically, efficiently, and consistently, from the development stage to the final product.

My goal is to develop and implement the best automation testing frameworks, tools, and practices to minimize effort and time spent on testing while enhancing the reliability and coverage of the test suite. I want to ensure that the automation testing process is seamlessly integrated into the development workflow and synchronized with other relevant processes, such as Agile or DevOps.

Additionally, I aspire to take on a leadership role in developing the automation testing team. I envision building a passionate, cohesive team with high proficiency in automation testing. I aim to guide and train team members, providing them with the necessary tools and resources to enhance and expand their automation testing capabilities.

With my commitment and passion for automation testing, I hope to make significant contributions to the company's success and drive positive change.
